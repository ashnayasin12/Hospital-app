                <h3 style="color:goldenrod"><b>ABOUT US</b></h3>
                <h5 style="color:darkred"><b>Personalised Care Personally</b></h5>
                <h6>What drives every one of our doctors at PRIME Hospital is the relationship they have with their patients.
                    It probably explains why they treat our hospital as their second home. Why our specialists and doctors know every one of their patients by name. When the hospital becomes an extended family to every one of our patients.</h6>
                <h5 style="color:darkred"><b>When Medical Care becomes Personal Care</b></h5>
                <h6>Personalized care is at the heart of Prime Hospital’s offering. 
                    Every one of our medical team of the best consultants and specialists, combine years of proven experience, and are trained to handle both medical and surgical emergencies for 24/7 
                    What makes them different is the approach to every patient. Rather than conveying the nature of the problem and symptom, the focus is solution-led. 
                    It’s where the fear of intensive operations and complicated procedures are put to rest and the doctor puts the patient at ease by simplifying their approach to the outcome and treatment</h6>

                <h6>It all started with a vision of becoming “the region’s most respected healthcare provider” by offering personalized, comprehensive, and affordable quality healthcare. One that produces the most effective treatment outcomes through the best-in-class professionals. 
                   This was the vision on which the PRIME Healthcare Group LLC was built by Dr. Jamil Ahmed an Orthopedic Surgeon trained in India and Germany, in partnership with prominent local partners.
